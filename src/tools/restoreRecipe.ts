/**
 * Restore-recipe builder for the snapshot envelope.
 *
 * The recipe encodes the choreography an AI must follow to restore a snapshot to a
 * Hydrawise controller. Each step is `{ order, tool, args, depends_on, notes? }`. The
 * AI's restore loop is: for each step in order, call `step.tool` with `step.args` and
 * `preview: true` first, show the diff, get user confirmation, then call again with
 * `preview: false`. The restore-irrigation-backup skill is the runtime executor of
 * this plan.
 *
 * Design constraints (from openspec/changes/add-restore-guidance/design.md):
 * - Pure function over the snapshot data — no live API calls, no I/O, no state.
 * - Snapshot file is self-sufficient: anyone with the snapshot can re-derive the recipe.
 * - Hard-coded restore order encoded here in source so it's reviewable / testable.
 * - depends_on encodes the deterministic dependency graph (custom sensor types before
 *   sensors that reference them, programs before zone settings that reference them).
 * - args are the same shape the AI would pass to the named tool MINUS the `preview`
 *   field — the AI injects preview at call time (true first, then false).
 */
