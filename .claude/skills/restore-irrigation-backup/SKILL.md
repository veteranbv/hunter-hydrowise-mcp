description: Apply a Hydrawise snapshot to a controller. Use when the user says "restore my irrigation backup", "apply this snapshot", "restore from snapshot", "apply backup file", or any phrasing indicating they want to push a previously-captured snapshot file's state back to a Hydrawise controller. The snapshot file embeds a `_restore_recipe` block that this skill executes step-by-step with preview-then-apply confirmation.

# Restore an irrigation backup

Apply a Hydrawise snapshot file (produced by `dump_controller_snapshot`) to a controller. The snapshot embeds a `_restore_recipe` array — the AI's playbook — which this skill walks step-by-step, previewing each mutation, confirming with the user, then applying.

## Trigger phrases

- "restore my irrigation backup"
- "apply this snapshot"
- "restore from snapshot"
- "apply backup file `<path>`"
- "restore controller `<id>` from `<snapshot file>`"

## Inputs

- **Required**: a snapshot file path OR pasted JSON content.
- **Optional**: target `controller_id` (defaults to the snapshot's `controller.id` if not specified).

## Workflow

### 1. Load and validate the snapshot

- If the user gave a file path, read it. Otherwise parse the pasted JSON.
- Check `snapshot_version`:
  - **`< 5`**: STOP — this snapshot predates `_restore_recipe` and cannot be replayed. Tell the user to re-capture using the current server.
  - **`>= 5 and < 6` (pre-v6)**: STOP immediately with this message:
    > "This snapshot uses pre-v6 field names (e.g. `cycle_custom_time`, `factors`, `interval`, `delay`) that are incompatible with the current server's v6 naming convention (`cycle_custom_time_minutes`, `monthly_adjustment_percents`, `interval_days`, `delay_seconds`, etc.). The embedded `_restore_recipe` args will fail Zod validation if replayed against this server. **Do not proceed.** Re-capture the snapshot using the current server first: run the `capture-irrigation-snapshot` skill, then use the new v6 snapshot file."
    Do NOT attempt to replay a v5 recipe. Do NOT manually translate field names.
  - **`>= 6`**: proceed.
- Extract `snapshot.controller.id`, `snapshot._restore_recipe`, and `snapshot._caveats`.

### 2. Verify the target controller

- Call `list_controllers` and `get_controller(snapshot.controller.id)`.
- If the controller doesn't exist on the live account: stop and report — the snapshot may be from a different account.
- If the live controller is online but in a different `program_mode` than the snapshot, surface this prominently — the recipe's first step (`update_controller_program_mode`) will switch modes and that DISCARDS the live mode's schedule data. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

### 3. Diff zones (name + number)

- Call `list_zones(snapshot.controller.id)`.
- Compare snapshot zones (snapshot.controller.zones[]) against live zones by `(name, number)` pair.
- Report the diff to the user:
  - Snapshot has zones live doesn't → these need `create_zone` calls (the recipe does NOT auto-emit these; they're added by you, the AI, with the user's blessing). Build the `create_zone` payloads from the snapshot's zone settings.
  - Live has zones snapshot doesn't → propose `delete_zone` calls. Get explicit user confirmation; deletion is destructive.
  - Same `(name, number)` exists on both sides → no zone-CRUD action needed; the recipe's `update_zone_settings` step will reconcile the per-zone state.
- If zone CRUD is needed, run those steps BEFORE the recipe (after step 5 caveats but before step 6 below).

### 4. Present `_caveats` up front

Caveats are tiered:

- **FYI caveats** (those starting with the literal prefix `"FYI: "`) — display as a single info line; do NOT prompt for individual acknowledgement. These are reminders the user can ignore in the common case (e.g. sensor wiring hasn't changed). Bundle them after the safety-critical caveats so they don't crowd the prompt loop.
- **Safety-critical caveats** (everything else) — display each one and ask: "Acknowledge?" The user must respond before proceeding.

Specific safety-critical caveats:

- If a caveat mentions **unit-pref drift** (watering triggers captured in F/mph but live account uses C/kph, etc.) — STOP. Do not proceed until the user explicitly tells you whether to convert values. Applying the recipe verbatim would produce numerically wrong results (97°F captured → 97 restored as °C scorches the lawn).
- If a caveat mentions **custom sensor types** — note that the recipe's `create_sensor` steps reference snapshot-time `model_id`s that won't exist on the new account; you'll re-resolve the new ids after each `create_custom_sensor_type` succeeds (see step 6).
- If a caveat mentions **unreadable fields** — note that `update_zone_settings` steps will have null values for required fields; you'll merge with live state at execute time (see step 6).
- If a caveat mentions **reusable `schedule_adjustment_ids`** — do NOT just collect an acknowledgement. Acknowledgement is not verification: these ids are opaque account-managed integers, and an id whose *definition* changed since capture restores silently wrong watering behavior (no error, no failed step). Run the comparison in step 4a below before proceeding.

#### 4a. Verify schedule adjustments (when the snapshot references any)

Trigger: the snapshot has a reusable-`schedule_adjustment_ids` caveat, or any program in `snapshot.controller.programs[]` has a non-empty `schedule_adjustment_ids`.

1. Call `list_watering_adjustments(controller_id)` on the **target** controller to read its live catalog.
2. Build the capture-time reference set from the snapshot: each program's `schedule_adjustments` (`{id, label}` pairs, snapshot v9+) plus `snapshot.controller.watering_adjustment_catalog` (which also carries `applicable_scheduling_method`).
3. For every referenced id, compare **id + label + applicable_scheduling_method together**. Matching on id alone is not sufficient and matching on label alone is not sufficient — the same label legitimately appears under different ids for different scheduling methods (e.g. "Forecast below 50°F" can exist as a Time Based id, a Smart Watering id, and a Virtual Solar Sync id simultaneously).
4. Classify and act:
   - **Exact match** (id, label, and method all agree) → verified; proceed.
   - **Id present but label or method differs** → STOP. The id was redefined between capture and restore. Show the user both sides (captured vs live) and ask explicitly whether to keep the snapshot's id, substitute the live id whose label+method matches the captured meaning, or drop the adjustment. Do not guess.
   - **Id absent from the live catalog** → STOP and report. The restore step referencing it will fail loudly, so surface it now rather than mid-recipe. If a live entry has the same label+method under a different id, offer that substitution.
5. **Pre-v9 snapshot, or `watering_adjustment_catalog` captured as `[]`** (the caveat says so explicitly): the snapshot cannot back the comparison on its own. Tell the user the ids cannot be verified from this snapshot, show the live catalog so they can confirm the intended meanings by hand, and get explicit confirmation before proceeding.

Report the comparison as a short table (id, captured label, live label, method, verdict) rather than prose.

### 5. Recommend a savepoint

Recommend (don't enforce): "Before I run this restore, I can capture a fresh snapshot of the current live state of controller `{id}` as a savepoint. If anything goes wrong mid-restore, you can use that snapshot to recover. Want me to do that?"

If yes, invoke the `capture-irrigation-snapshot` skill with the live controller's id and store the file path.

### 6. Walk the recipe

For each step in `snapshot._restore_recipe` (in `order` ascending):

#### a. Check `depends_on`

If any dependency step has not yet been successfully applied, halt with an error — the recipe order should make this impossible, but verify defensively.

#### b. Pre-process the args (per-step rules)

- **`update_zone_settings`**: if the step's args contain `null` for required fields (watering_mode, global_master_valve, watering_type, watering_frequency_mode, etc. — see the per-step `notes` field), call `get_zone_settings(zone_id)` first, take the live values for the null fields, and merge over the snapshot's non-null values. The MERGED payload is what you preview/apply.
- **`create_sensor` referencing a custom type** (the step's `notes` say "model_id refers to the custom type created above"): look up the prior `create_custom_sensor_type` step's RESULT (the SensorModel object returned), extract the new `id`, and substitute it for the snapshot-time `model_id` in this step's args.
- **`update_standard_program`**: the snapshot doesn't capture `program_type`, `day_pattern`, `run_duration` (for every zone in `zone_run_times`), or `ignore_rain_sensor` — they arrive as `null` in the recipe args. **You MUST call `get_program(controller_id, program_id, "Standard")` first**, take those fields from the live program, and merge the snapshot's non-null values over. Do NOT apply this step with null `run_duration` values — doing so silently zeros out every zone's run time with no error from Zod or the API. **If `get_program` fails or the program is not found on the live controller, STOP immediately** — do not attempt to merge or apply. Report as follows, then tell the user they must reconcile the missing program before re-running the restore from the beginning:
  - If `get_program` throws an error: report which step failed and the error text verbatim.
  - If `get_program` returns successfully but the program with `program_id` is absent from the result: report which `program_id` is missing from the live controller.
- **`create_program_start_time`**: the snapshot doesn't capture all required fields (apply_all, zones, schedules, days-of-week ints) — the recipe emits the captured `time` and `zones` (translated from `zone_ids`) plus null for everything else. Call `list_program_start_times_for_zone(zone_id)` to inspect the live state.
  - **Idempotency check** (skip if already present): match the recipe's `args.time` (HH:MM string) against each live start time's `time` field.
    - **If no time match exists**: fall through to the build-payload step below. No warning needed — this is the normal case for a brand-new start time.
    - **If a time match is found**, first check for an empty recipe zone list:
      - **If `recipe.zones` is empty** (suspicious — may indicate a snapshot serialization bug): emit a warning — "recipe has empty zone list for start time {time}; a live start time already exists at this time — zones cannot be compared." Prompt the user to inspect the snapshot and decide whether to apply or skip. If the user says apply, note that `list_program_start_times_for_zone` does not return `watering_type`, `time_type`, or the integer day-of-week fields — the tool call will be rejected by Zod input validation until these are supplied (validation runs before the tool handler, regardless of `preview` flag). **Prompt the user to supply ALL of the following; do not proceed until every field is provided: `watering_type` (Int), `time_type` (String), `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday` (all Int). If the user supplies only some, re-prompt for the rest.** Then build the payload: `controller_id` and `time`/`zones = []` from the recipe, `apply_all` from the matched live start time's `application.all`, the user-supplied fields, and `schedules = []` (the snapshot does not capture this field; it is write-only and not returned by `list_program_start_times_for_zone` — pass `[]` as the safe default). Proceed to the preview step. If the user says skip, record as "skipped — empty recipe zones, user declined."
      - **If `recipe.zones` is non-empty**, classify by zone-set relationship between `recipe.zones` and the matched `live.zones`:
        - **Live zones ⊇ recipe zones (superset or equal)**: the start time is fully covered — skip this step. If the sets are equal, record as "skipped — already present." If live has *extra* zones beyond the recipe (strict superset), record as "skipped — live is wider than snapshot" and emit a warning (list the step order, the recipe zones, and the live zones found during the idempotency check).
        - **All other cases** (live is a strict subset of recipe zones — including empty live zones — or completely disjoint zone sets): do NOT skip — apply the step to restore the full zone set. Record the zone-set mismatch as a warning in the final report (list recipe zones vs. live zones found during the idempotency check). `list_program_start_times_for_zone` does not return `watering_type`, `time_type`, or the integer day-of-week fields. **Prompt the user to supply ALL of the following; do not proceed until every field is provided: `watering_type` (Int), `time_type` (String), `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday` (all Int). If the user supplies only some, re-prompt for the rest.** Then **build the payload**: `controller_id` and `time`/`zones` from the recipe, `apply_all` from the matched live start time's `application.all`, the user-supplied fields, and `schedules = []` (the snapshot does not capture this field; it is write-only and not returned by `list_program_start_times_for_zone` — pass `[]` as the safe default). Proceed to the preview step.
  - **If no time match exists**, `watering_type`, `time_type`, the seven day-of-week integer fields, `apply_all`, and `schedules` are not captured in the snapshot. **Prompt the user to supply ALL of the following; do not proceed until every field is provided: `apply_all` (Boolean), `watering_type` (Int), `time_type` (String), `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday` (all Int), `schedules` ([Int], pass `[]` if no schedule adjustments apply). If the user supplies only some, re-prompt for the rest.** Then build the payload: `controller_id`, `time`, and `zones` from the recipe plus the user-supplied fields.

#### c. Preview the step

Call `step.tool({ ...mergedArgs, preview: true })`. Show the user the planned variables.

If preview returns an error, halt: report which step failed, what state was achieved before this point, and what the error said. Do NOT continue to the next step (the recipe is fail-fast).

#### d. Confirm and apply

Show the user a one-line summary: "Step {order}/{total}: {tool} on {target} → {brief description from notes or args}. Apply?"

If yes, call `step.tool({ ...mergedArgs, preview: false })`. Record the result (especially for `create_*` steps where you'll need the returned id for downstream `depends_on`).

If no, halt: "Restore halted at step {order}. {N} steps applied; {M} remaining."

#### e. Continue

Repeat (a) through (d) for the next step.

### 7. Final report

When all steps complete (or restore halts), report:

- Total steps in recipe.
- Steps successfully applied.
- Steps skipped (with reason — e.g., zone CRUD diff, already-present, user declined).
- Steps that failed (which step, what error, what live state was last verified).
- Warnings (e.g., `create_program_start_time` steps skipped because live zones were a strict superset of recipe zones; `create_program_start_time` steps applied because live zones did not cover the full recipe zone set (strict subset, disjoint, or empty live zones); recipe steps where `recipe.zones` was empty and a live time match was found). For superset-skip and zone-mismatch-apply warnings, list the step order, the recipe zones, and the live zones found during the idempotency check. For empty-recipe-zones warnings, list the step order, the start time, and the live zones of the matched live entry.
- The savepoint file path (if step 5 created one).
- Recommendation: "Capture a fresh snapshot now to verify the restored state matches the source."

## Failure handling

- **Fail-fast**: halt on first failure. Do NOT auto-retry; do NOT roll back. Hydrawise mutations aren't transactional and a partial-restore state is recoverable from the savepoint snapshot from step 5.
- **Report**: name the failed step's `order` and `tool`, surface the underlying error message verbatim, list which prior steps succeeded.
- **Hand off**: tell the user to inspect the GUI, fix the immediate issue, and either re-run the restore (which will preview-then-apply the remaining steps) or restore from the savepoint snapshot to get back to the pre-restore state.

## Rules

- ALWAYS preview every step (`preview: true`) before applying. NEVER call a write tool with `preview: false` without showing the user the planned variables first.
- NEVER apply the recipe verbatim if `_caveats` includes a unit-pref mismatch. Halt until the user reconciles.
- NEVER skip the zone-diff step (workflow step 3). Restoring a snapshot to a controller with different zones than the snapshot was captured from will silently apply settings to the wrong zones.
- NEVER assume the recipe is complete. Each step's `notes` field may flag fields the AI must merge from live state; honor those notes.

## What this skill is NOT

- **Not a single-tool restore**. There is intentionally no `restore_from_backup` MCP tool; restore is the AI's choreography of `update_*`/`create_*` calls, gated by `preview: true` confirmation. This skill IS the restore workflow.
- **Not transactional**. Hydrawise mutations don't roll back; partial restore is the user's problem to recover from (savepoint snapshot helps).
- **Not silent**. Every mutation requires explicit user confirmation after preview.
